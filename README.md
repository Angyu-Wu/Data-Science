# Rainfall Prediction in R
•	Performed feature engineering to clean data.

•	Built a decision tree model and a multiple perceptron (MLP) model, achieving 80% in accuracy for the MLP model.

•	Evaluated two models on metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with confusion matrices. 

# Data set and statistical analysis in R.
